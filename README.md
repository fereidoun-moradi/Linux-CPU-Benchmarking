This program is deployed in order compare performance of different Linux scheduling policies such as FIFO, RR, OTHER (CFS), DEADLINE, BATCH and IDLE.
By this way the main function run a CPU based process as multi-thread.
Real Time, User Time and System Time of each thread calculate in addition tototal execution time of this program calculated in order to measure such interesting metrics like turnaround time, latency, fairness and efficiency of each scheduling policy in Linux machines
